\description{
ahp files are in YAML format, and they are self-contained, fully specified ahp problems. 
They contain two sections: \bold{alternatives} and \bold{goal}.
}
\details{
The \bold{alternatives} section contains a list of alternatives, where each alternative
may have a number of attributes.

The \bold{goal} section is a tree of criteria, 
each criteria having a \code{name}, a \code{preferences}  
attribute, and possible child criteria or alternatives.

To look at a sample file, type, see examples below or type \code{vignette("examples", package = "ahp")}. To learn
the details about the ahp file format, type \code{vignette("file-format", package = "ahp")}.
}
\examples{
ahpFile <- system.file("extdata", "car.ahp", package="ahp")

#look at a sample file
cat(readChar(ahpFile, file.info(ahpFile)$size))

#load the file into R
carAhp <- Load(ahpFile)
